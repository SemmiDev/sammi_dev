Hi folks\
I'm Sammi Aldhi Yanto, I'm a full time life long learner 😊

Currently 3rd Year `IS` Undergraduate Student at [Universitas Riau](https://unri.ac.id/en/).

Judging from the photo on the top right, I’m quite `handsome` right? 😎 Hehehe. Anyway, I'm now in 💝 with **[Go](https://golang.org)** & [**Cloud Native Enthuasiast**]().

In my spare time, I usually like to make content on my YouTube channel about `Programming`, mostly `Go`, `Algorithm & Data Structure`, `Coding Problem`, `Lecture Tasks` and `etc.`
