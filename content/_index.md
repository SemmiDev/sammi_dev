Hi folks\
nice to meet you here 😊


I’m **`Sammi Aldhi Yanto`**\
You can call me **`Sam`**\
Judging from the photo on the top right, I’m quite `handsome` right? 😎 Hehehe.

I'm currently 2nd Year `IS` (_Information System_) Undergraduate Student at [Universitas Riau](https://unri.ac.id/en/).

Anyway, I'm now in 💝 with **[Go](https://golang.org)** & `Cloud Native Technology Enthusiast`.

In my spare time I usually like to make content on my YouTube channel about `Programming` (mostly `Go`), `Algorithm & Data Structure`, `Coding Problem`, `Lecture Tasks` and `etc.`

---

I also offer programming assignment service `Joki Coding`
several programming languages that I offer:

* Go-Lang
* Java
* Rust
* PHP
* C/C++
* Python
* JS
* Kotlin
* etc...

The price depends on the complexity of the task\
